# Net Received Display Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a Net Received display on the create-stream form that shows users exactly what the recipient will receive after protocol fees are deducted.

## Problem Statement
Senders could not determine how much the recipient would actually receive due to protocol fees, making it impossible to communicate the net amount accurately without manual calculation.

## Solution Components

### 1. NetReceivedDisplay Component (`/components/NetReceivedDisplay.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Displays the net amount recipient will receive after fees
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatically fetches current protocol fee configuration from contract
  - Calculates net amount using: `net = deposit - floor(deposit * fee_rate)`
  - Shows fee amount and percentage
  - Real-time calculation as user types amount
  - Error handling for fee fetch failures
  - Multi-language support (English, Portuguese, Spanish)
  - Responsive design with blue info styling
  - Shows loading state while fetching fee config

### 2. UI Integration in Create-Stream Form
Added to `/src/app/stream/new/page.tsx`:
- Imported `NetReceivedDisplay` component
- Displayed conditionally below amount input when:
  - User has entered a valid amount
  - No validation errors on the amount field
  - Amount is greater than 0

### 3. Internationalization
Added 2 new translation keys to `stream_new` namespace across all languages:

#### English (`en.json`):
- `net_received_label` - "Net Received by Recipient"
- `net_received_fee_desc` - "After {fee_percent}% protocol fee"

#### Portuguese (`pt.json`):
- `net_received_label` - "Recebido Líquido pelo Destinatário"
- `net_received_fee_desc` - "Após taxa de protocolo de {fee_percent}%"

#### Spanish (`es.json`):
- `net_received_label` - "Recibido Neto por el Destinatario"
- `net_received_fee_desc` - "Después de la tarifa de protocolo del {fee_percent}%"

## Technical Details

### Component Props
```typescript
interface NetReceivedDisplayProps {
  amount: string;              // User-entered amount as string
  tokenSymbol: string;          // Token symbol (USDC, XLM, etc)
  isCustomToken?: boolean;      // Whether using custom token
}
```

### Fee Calculation
```
fee = floor(amount_stroops * basisPoints / 10_000)
net = amount_stroops - fee
feePercent = basisPoints / 100
```

Example:
- Amount: 100 USDC
- Fee: 0.5% (50 basis points)
- Fee deducted: 0.5 USDC
- Net received: 99.5 USDC

### Dependencies Used
- React hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`
- Custom utilities: `getFeeConfig()`, `calcWithdrawBreakdown()`
- i18n: `useTranslations()` hook

### State Management
- `feeBasisPoints`: Current protocol fee rate
- `feeLoading`: Loading state while fetching fee config
- `feeError`: Error state if fee fetch fails

## User Experience Flow

1. User enters create-stream form
2. User navigates to "Amount & Duration" step
3. User enters amount in the amount field
4. Net Received Display appears below amount input (if valid amount entered)
5. Display shows:
   - Label: "Net Received by Recipient"
   - Net amount in the specified token
   - Fee percentage and absolute fee amount
6. Display updates in real-time as user adjusts amount
7. Sender can now accurately communicate the net amount to recipient

### Display States
- **Loading**: Shows "Loading…" while fetching fee config
- **Error**: Shows "Fee config unavailable" if fetch fails (graceful degradation)
- **Ready**: Shows calculated net amount and fee information
- **Hidden**: Returns null if amount is empty or invalid

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
1. `/components/NetReceivedDisplay.tsx` (107 lines)
2. `/components/__tests__/NetReceivedDisplay.test.tsx` (test file)

### Modified:
1. `/src/app/stream/new/page.tsx`
   - Added import for `NetReceivedDisplay`
   - Added component rendering below amount input

2. `/src/locales/en.json`
   - Added `net_received_label`
   - Added `net_received_fee_desc`

3. `/src/locales/pt.json`
   - Added Portuguese translations for the above keys

4. `/src/locales/es.json`
   - Added Spanish translations for the above keys

## Key Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Users see exact net amount recipient will receive
2. **Real-time Updates**: Display updates instantly as amount changes
3. **Educational**: Shows fee percentage and absolute amount
4. **Reliable**: Fetches current fee from contract (not hardcoded)
5. **Accessible**: Proper color contrast and semantic HTML
6. **Internationalized**: Full support for 3 languages
7. **Graceful Degradation**: Works even if fee config fetch fails

## Design Decisions

1. **Location**: Placed directly below amount input for context
2. **Styling**: Blue background to differentiate from error/warning states
3. **Conditional Display**: Only shown when valid amount is entered (reduces visual noise)
4. **Real-time**: No delay in calculation (uses stroops for precision)
5. **Fee Fetching**: Per-amount calculation (not just on form submit)
6. **Error Handling**: Shows user-friendly message if fee config unavailable

## Verification

### Validation Performed:
1. ✅ Component exports correctly
2. ✅ Stream new page imports are correct
3. ✅ All translation keys exist across all three languages
4. ✅ Locale files are valid JSON
5. ✅ TypeScript syntax is correct
6. ✅ Fee calculation formula verified
7. ✅ Component structure matches existing patterns

### Fee Calculation Examples:
- 100 USDC @ 50 bps → 99.5 USDC net
- 1000 USDC @ 50 bps → 995 USDC net
- 50 USDC @ 100 bps → 49.5 USDC net

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing:
1. Enter create stream form
2. Navigate to "Amount & Duration" step
3. Enter different amounts (0, 0.01, 100, 1000)
4. Verify net amount displays only for valid amounts
5. Verify calculation matches expected fee deduction
6. Test with different token types (USDC, XLM, custom)
7. Test with different language settings
8. Simulate fee fetch failure (observe graceful degradation)
9. Test on mobile and desktop views

### Integration Testing:
1. Verify display appears when creating stream
2. Verify amount persists with other form fields
3. Verify display updates on amount change
4. Test with all supported tokens

## Notes
- Uses `calcWithdrawBreakdown` for consistency with review step calculations
- Fetches fee config dynamically (respects contract updates)
- No breaking changes to existing code
- Follows existing patterns in codebase
- Component is lightweight and performs well
- Gracefully handles network/fetch errors
