# Stream Comparison Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a stream comparison feature on the stream detail page that allows users to compare parameters between two streams side-by-side with difference highlighting.

## Problem Statement
Users had to open multiple browser tabs or manually write down values to audit and compare similar streams, making stream management cumbersome.

## Solution Components

### 1. StreamComparisonModal Component (`/components/StreamComparisonModal.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Modal dialog for comparing two streams side-by-side
- **Key Features**:
  - Searchable dropdown to select a second stream
  - Filters out the current stream from available options
  - Search functionality by Stream ID, Recipient, or Sender address
  - Side-by-side comparison table showing:
    - Stream ID
    - Status (with color-coded badges)
    - Recipient (using FederationName component)
    - Amount (USDC)
    - Flow Rate (USDC/sec)
    - Start Date & End Date
    - Duration (in days)
    - Auto-Renew status
  - **Difference Highlighting**: Differing values are highlighted with amber background and text
  - **Accessibility**: 
    - Focus trap using `useFocusTrap` hook
    - Keyboard support (Escape to close)
    - Proper ARIA labels
  - **Internationalization**: Full support for English, Portuguese, and Spanish

### 2. State Management in Stream Detail Page
Added to `/src/app/stream/[id]/page.tsx`:
- `showComparisonModal` state - controls modal visibility
- `allStreams` state - stores all streams for the current wallet
- `useEffect` hook - loads all streams when wallet address changes using `getStreamsForWallet()`

### 3. UI Integration
- **Compare Button**: Added after the "Embed Widget" button on stream detail page
- **Button Behavior**:
  - Disabled when user has only one stream
  - Shows tooltip: "Create another stream to compare"
  - Uses comparison icon (2 parallel lines with circles)
  - Opens StreamComparisonModal on click

### 4. Internationalization
Added 22 new translation keys across three languages:

#### English (`en.json`):
- `compare` - "Compare"
- `compare_modal_title` - "Compare Streams"
- `compare_select_stream` - "Select a stream to compare"
- And 19 more keys for labels and UI text

#### Portuguese (`pt.json`):
- All keys translated to Portuguese
- Professional translations matching existing terminology

#### Spanish (`es.json`):
- All keys translated to Spanish
- Professional translations matching existing terminology

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Used
- React hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useMemo`
- Custom hooks: `useFocusTrap`, `useTranslations`
- Existing utilities: `formatStellarAmount`, `formatStreamAmount`, `FederationName`

### Component Props
```typescript
interface StreamComparisonModalProps {
  open: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  currentStream: StreamData;
  availableStreams: StreamData[];
}
```

### Difference Detection
- Compares string representations of values
- Highlights rows where `String(value1) !== String(value2)`
- Uses amber coloring for visual distinction

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
1. `/components/StreamComparisonModal.tsx` (448 lines)
2. `/components/__tests__/StreamComparisonModal.test.tsx` (test file)

### Modified:
1. `/src/app/stream/[id]/page.tsx`
   - Added imports for `getStreamsForWallet`, `StreamComparisonModal`, `useTranslations`
   - Added state: `showComparisonModal`, `allStreams`
   - Added useEffect to load all streams
   - Added Compare button UI
   - Rendered StreamComparisonModal component

2. `/src/locales/en.json`
   - Added 22 translation keys under `stream_detail` namespace

3. `/src/locales/pt.json`
   - Added 22 translation keys under `stream_detail` namespace

4. `/src/locales/es.json`
   - Added 22 translation keys under `stream_detail` namespace

## User Experience Flow

1. User navigates to a stream detail page
2. User sees "Compare" button (enabled if they have multiple streams)
3. User clicks Compare button
4. Modal opens with dropdown to select a comparison stream
5. User can search by ID, recipient, or sender address
6. User selects a stream to compare
7. Modal displays side-by-side comparison with:
   - 3-column layout: Parameter | Current Stream | Comparison Stream
   - Differing values highlighted in amber
   - All key stream parameters visible
8. User can close modal by:
   - Clicking the X button
   - Clicking the Close button
   - Pressing Escape key

## Accessibility Features
- Focus trap ensures keyboard navigation stays within modal
- ARIA labels for dialog
- Semantic HTML structure
- Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- Keyboard shortcut support (Escape)
- Screen reader friendly with proper heading hierarchy

## Testing

### Validation Performed:
1. ✅ Component exports correctly
2. ✅ Stream detail page imports are correct
3. ✅ All translation keys exist across all three languages
4. ✅ JSON locale files are valid
5. ✅ TypeScript syntax is correct
6. ✅ Component structure matches existing patterns

### Manual Testing Recommended:
1. Test with multiple streams in wallet
2. Test search functionality with different query types
3. Test difference highlighting with streams having different parameters
4. Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Escape)
5. Test with different language settings
6. Test modal opening/closing
7. Test responsive design on mobile

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add export functionality (CSV/PDF)
- Add more stream parameters to comparison
- Add visual charts comparing flow rates over time
- Add ability to compare more than 2 streams simultaneously
- Add comparison presets/templates
- Add comparison history

## Notes
- Component follows existing design patterns in the codebase
- Uses same modal styling as other modals (WithdrawConfirmModal, StreamQrModal)
- Integrates seamlessly with existing i18n system
- No breaking changes to existing code
- Disabled state shows helpful tooltip when only one stream exists
