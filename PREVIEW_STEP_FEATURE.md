# Stream Preview Step - Feature Overview

## What's New

The SoroStream create-stream form now includes a **Preview step** that shows you exactly what your stream will look like on-chain before you sign with your wallet.

## The Problem It Solves

Previously, users would fill out the form and proceed directly to wallet confirmation without seeing the actual stream parameters. This led to:
- Users signing streams with unexpected flow rates
- Confusion about when streams would end
- Surprises about protocol fees
- User errors and regretted transactions

## The Solution

A new Preview step appears after you enter the amount and duration, showing:

### 1. 📊 Flow Rate Per Day
How much of your token will stream out each day
- Example: 14.29 USDC/day (for 100 USDC over 7 days)
- Helps you understand the rate of payment

### 2. 💰 Total Amount
The total amount you're streaming
- Shows the exact amount you'll commit
- Matches what you entered

### 3. 📅 Stream Ends
When your stream will complete
- Exact date and time
- Includes seconds for precision
- Example: "Jul 31, 2026 14:30"

### 4. 🏦 Estimated Protocol Fee
The protocol fee that will be deducted
- Calculated from your amount
- Shown with full precision
- Example: "0.5 USDC" (on 0.5% fee rate)

### 5. 🔄 Recipient & Sender
Both parties involved in the stream
- Recipient address you're paying
- Your address as sender
- Verify before confirming

## Calculation Details

### Flow Rate Per Day
The form calculates how much flows per 24 hours:

```
Formula: (Amount × 86,400) / Duration in Seconds

Examples:
- 100 USDC over 1 day = 100 USDC/day
- 100 USDC over 7 days = 14.29 USDC/day
- 100 USDC over 30 days = 3.33 USDC/day
- 10 XLM over 1 hour = 240 XLM/day
```

### End Date Calculation
Shows exactly when your stream will complete based on start time + duration.

### Protocol Fee
Estimated fee is calculated from current protocol fee rate (typically 0.5% or 50 basis points).

## Common Questions

### Q: Is the preview always accurate?
**A:** Yes! The preview uses the exact same calculations as the on-chain protocol. The protocol fee shown is an estimate based on current rates - the final fee may vary slightly if rates change before confirmation, but will be shown exactly on the Review step.

### Q: Can I skip the preview?
**A:** No, it's a required step to ensure you understand your stream parameters before signing. This prevents user errors.

### Q: Why did you add this step?
**A:** User testing showed that without a preview, people would sometimes:
- Not realize how fast their money was flowing out
- Be surprised by the end date
- Not see protocol fees until too late to edit

The preview solves all three problems.

### Q: Does the preview cost anything?
**A:** No, it's completely free. It's just a form step - no transaction or fee involved.

### Q: Can I edit after seeing the preview?
**A:** Yes! Click "Back" to return to the Amount & Duration step. You can change:
- Amount
- Duration
- Token
- End date / Cliff date
- Any other advanced settings

Then click "Next" again to see the updated preview.

### Q: What happens if my network is slow?
**A:** The preview calculations are instant (no network needed). They all happen in your browser!

### Fee Information

## Troubleshooting

### Preview shows unexpected flow rate
**Check:** Make sure your duration and amount are correct. The preview calculates: (Amount × 86,400) ÷ Duration_in_Seconds

### End date seems wrong
**Check:** The end date is calculated from now + duration. If it seems off, verify your duration is set correctly.

### Protocol fee looks high
**Check:** The fee rate is set by the protocol (typically 0.5%). This is deducted from what the recipient gets.
